Code used to revise the manuscript between October and December 2023 in response to reviewers. Changes include:
- Focusing on CMRs discovered in females which replicated in independent samples
- Adding a sex-combined EWAS and sensitivity analyses for levodopa equivalent dosage and time since pesticide exposure
- Adding power calculations and null EWAS where PD status was shuffled
- Adding a sensitivity analysis adjusting for lag time between exposure and blood draw when computing association between G+E and GxE effects on DNAm at CMRs
